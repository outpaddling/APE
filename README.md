APE
===
APE, Another Programmer's Editor, is a terminal-based, menu-driven integrated
development environment (IDE).

It was originally developed in the early 1990s to combine the convenience of
DOS-based IDEs such as Borland C and Microsoft QuickC with the power and
stability of Unix.

It is still useful today as a common programming editor for a variety of
languages.

As a terminal-based editor, it functions as efficiently in a PuTTY terminal as
it does on a graphical console.

It offers user-configurable language support including regular-expression-based syntax highlighting.
