APE
===

APE (Another Programmer's Editor) is a terminal-based, menu-driven
integrated development environment (IDE) for Unix-compatible systems.

Early development predates currently maintained BSD systems and Linux,
having occurred on a 20MHz 80286 PC running Coherent, a low-cost commercial
Unix-like system from the Mark Williams Company.  Development shifted
primarily to FreeBSD by the mid-1990s, as affordable 32-bit hardware
became available, and open source operating systems came of age.

The goal of APE was to combine the efficient workflow of DOS-based IDEs such
as Borland C and Microsoft QuickC with the power and stability of Unix.

APE is still actively maintained today as a common programming editor
for a variety of languages.  No major features have been added since the
1990s, but support for many new languages has been added to the default
configuration files.  APE provides basic compiler/interpreter and debugger
interfacing, as well as regular expression based syntax highlighting for
most popular languages, as well as a few you've probably never heard of.

As a terminal-based editor, APE functions as efficiently in a PuTTY
terminal as it does on a graphical console.  So, while APE does not have
a graphical user interface, it can be used just about anywhere, even over
the slowest of network connections to headless servers (or cloud instances)
with no X11 or Wayland installation.
