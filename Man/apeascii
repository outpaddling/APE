       ASCII is a  standard binary code used to represent charac-
       ter  data   on   computers.    Most   existing  computers,
       printers, terminals, etc.  use the ASCII code to  communi-
       cate with each other.   Older IBM systems such as 360 fam-
       ily mainframes use another code  called  EEBBCCDDIICC  (Extended
       Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).

       The   standard   ASCII   code  uses  7  bits  to represent
       each character.   This  provides  codes  from  0000000  to
       1111111 (0 to 127  decimal).    Modern  computers  use  an
       8  bit   ASCII  character,  although   the  latter  codes,
       10000000  to  11111111  (128 to 255 decimal) are not stan-
       dardized.

       Codes 00000000 to 00011111 (0 to 31 decimal) are the  ccoonn--
       ttrrooll  cchhaarraacctteerrss..  These characters has various effects on
       printers and terminals.  For example, sending a  line-feed
       (LF)  character to  a printer causes the paper  to scroll.
       Sending the same  character to   an  ASCII  terminal  will
       cause  the  cursor  to  move  down,  the analog to a paper
       scroll on a printer.   If the cursor  is  already  at  the
       bottom  of   the  screen, then the screen  will scroll up.
       The following is a list  of  the  control  characters  and
       their purpose:

        NUL     0               No effect - marker or delay

     Codes  00100000  to  01111110 (32  to  126  decimal are  the
     printable characters.

     The printable characters are grouped in several sections.

     Code 00100000 (32 decimal) is the space character.

     Codes 00110000 to 00111001  (48 to 57 decimal) are the digit
     characters  '0' to '9'.  The cchhaarraacctteerr '0' has ASCII code 48
     When you type '0'  on your keyboard, the computer receives a
     binary  00110000  (48 decimal)  from  your  terminal, not  a
     binary 0.

     Codes  01000001  to  01011011 (65  to  71  decimal) are  the
     capital letters.

     Codes 01100001 to 01111011 (97 to 123 decimal) are the lower
     case letters.   Note that the  code for a  lower case letter
     differs by only 1 bit from  the code for the same upper case
     letter.   This  feature  is  intended  to  make it  easy  to
     capitalize or decapitalize text.

     Code 01111111 (127 decimal) is the delete character.

     All remaining codes  between the digits and letters are used
     for various punctuation symbols.

       The following  is a table  of  all  256  characters.   The
       appearance   of non-standard  characters 128 to 255 (third
       and fourth columns) will  depend  on the type of  terminal
       you  are  viewing  this  on.  If your terminal supports an
       alternate character set, it will be  shown  following  the
       standard character set.
