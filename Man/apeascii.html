<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>

<P>
ASCII is a  standard binary code used to represent character
data  on  computers.   Most  existing  computers,  printers,
terminals, etc.  use the ASCII code to communicate with each
other.   Older IBM systems such as 360 family mainframes use
another code called
<B>EBCDIC</B>
(Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).

<P>
The  standard  ASCII  code uses  7  bits  to represent  each
character.  This provides codes from 0000000 to 1111111 (0 to
127  decimal).    Modern  computers  use  an   8  bit  ASCII
character, although  the latter codes,  10000000 to 11111111
(128 to 255 decimal) are not standardized.

<P>
Codes 00000000 to 00011111 (0 to 31 decimal) are the
<B>control characters.</B>
These characters has various
effects on printers and terminals.  For example,
sending a  line-feed (LF) character to  a printer causes the
paper  to scroll.   Sending the same  character to  an ASCII
terminal will cause the cursor to move down, the analog to a
paper scroll on a printer.   If the cursor is already at the
bottom of  the screen, then the screen  will scroll up.  The
following is a list of the control characters and their purpose:

DC3     19              Device control 3
DC4     20              Device control 4
NAK     21              Negative acknowledgement
SYN     22              Syncronize

</PRE>

<P>
Codes  00100000  to  01111110 (32  to  126  decimal are  the
printable characters.

<P>
The printable characters are grouped in several sections.

<P>
Code 00100000 (32 decimal) is the space character.

<P>
Codes 00110000 to 00111001  (48 to 57 decimal) are the digit
characters '0' to '9'.  The
<B>character</B>
'0' has ASCII code 48
When you type '0'  on your keyboard, the computer receives a
binary  00110000  (48 decimal)  from  your  terminal, not  a
binary 0.

<P>
Codes  01000001  to  01011011 (65  to  71  decimal) are  the
capital letters.

<P>
Codes 01100001 to 01111011 (97 to 123 decimal) are the lower
case letters.   Note that the  code for a  lower case letter
differs by only 1 bit from  the code for the same upper case
letter.   This  feature  is  intended  to  make it  easy  to
capitalize or decapitalize text.

<P>
Code 01111111 (127 decimal) is the delete character.

<P>
All remaining codes  between the digits and letters are used
for various punctuation symbols.

<P>
The following  is a table of all 256 characters.  The
appearance  of non-standard  characters 128 to 255
(third and fourth columns) will  depend  on the
type of terminal you are viewing this on.  If your terminal
supports an alternate character set, it will be shown
following the standard character set.
